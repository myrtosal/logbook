Well, after travelling around the globe, it is time to see another planet.

Lets go and check Cydonia, with the Martian face and the Martian pyramid..


Cydonia (/sɪˈdoʊniə/, /saɪˈdoʊniə/) is a region on the planet Mars that has attracted both scientific[1] and popular 
interest.[2][3] The name originally referred to the albedo feature (distinctively coloured area) that was visible from 
Earthbound telescopes. The area borders plains of Acidalia Planitia and the Arabia Terra highlands.[4] The area includes 
the regions: "Cydonia Mensae", an area of flat-topped mesa-like features, "Cydonia Colles", a region of small hills or 
knobs, and "Cydonia Labyrinthus", a complex of intersecting valleys. As with other albedo features on Mars, the 
name Cydonia was drawn from classical antiquity, in this case from Cydonia or Kydonia (/sɪˈdoʊniə/; Ancient Greek: 
Κυδωνία; Latin: Cydonia), a historic polis (city state) on the island of Crete. Cydonia contains the "Face on Mars", 
located about halfway between Arandas Crater and Bamberg Crater.
